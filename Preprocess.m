function [PSWFs, w_vec] = Preprocess(L)
% A function to generate the 2D prolates functions of zero
% angular frequency and calculates a vector of weights to be assigned to
% every ring, according to the number of pixels it contains.
% A variant of @Boris Landa code.
%
% Input
% L -- Image resolution, assume our image is of (2*L+1)X(2*L+1)
%
% Output
% PSWFs -- A struct which contains the PSWFs with their generation parameters, specifically:
%             samples:    PSWF basis functions, samplned on the Cartesian grid inside the unit disk. Columns correspond to different indices. 
%             Alpha_Nn:   PSWF associated eigenvalues.
%             ang_freq:   Angular frequency ('N' indices) of the PSWFs.
%             rad_freq:   Radial frequency ('n' indices) of the PSWFs.
% w_vec -- the weight vector
